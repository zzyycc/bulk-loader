# Project Status #

Bulk loader has been used in many projects, and is considered stable. If you are confortable using svn, I recommend to follow trunk, as the API is stable an very few (if any) backwards incompatible changes should happened. Else, I'll try to keep the downloadable version up to date as much as possible.
