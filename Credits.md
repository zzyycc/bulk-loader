THIS WIKI HAS MOVED to the new github page, please access it at http://github.com/arthur-debert/BulkLoader/wiki .

## Main Author ##
This library has been developed by [Arthur Debert](http://www.stimuli.com.br/), but it owes a whole lot to the folks who have given input, ideas, criticisms, and bug reports.

## Many thanks to ##
  * **Dimitar Genov** (dimitar71 at hotmail.com ) who besides having great design discussion, implemented general cleanup code and the code creating bulk loaders from external files (xml).

  * **Igor Almeida**: my coworker who has been a thorough beta tester. A couple of months ago he wrote a loading manager class that, while has little resemblance to BulkLoader, provided many insights and a good road map of what works (and what doesn't). He also provided valuable feedback and bug reports.

  * [Zeh](http://www.zeh.com.br/): in long emails Zeh has given valuable ideas and discussed a few key issues Having Zeh give you design ideas is (to steal a phrase from [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)) like having Mick Jagger playing on your son's Bar Mitzvah.

  * [Pedro Moraes](http://www.pedromoraes.net) For great feedback and feature suggestions.
